# cpp-snake-console-game
Simple Snake console Game Written in C++


The idea was to write it in pure C, but in C I do not have access to the 
terminal in order to check if a key is pressed or not.

# Features
1. Infinite loop through the entire map
2. catch a dot and increase the size of the snake
3. if you bite yourself - Game Over :)
4. ...

# TODO
 - move from structure to classes since we are in C
 - cleanup the code
 - check for WIN :)
 - make the map dynamic from the args
 - make the initial snake size to be calculated based on the given map size - like no end up with 9 items with 20x20 map
